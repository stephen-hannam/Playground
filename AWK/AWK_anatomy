Processing text line by line

On the CLI:

$ awk 'PATTERN { ACTION }' file1 [file2 ... ]

PATTERN can be:
  * regex
  * boolean condition/s
  * relational expression (==, !=, >, <, etc)
  * ternary operator
  * ranged pattern

print ACTION:
  -- COLUMNS numbered 1 -> N
  -- print $0 means 'print the whole line; ie, all columns'

DEREF with $: so $NF derefs the NF built-in var

BUILT-IN vars:
  -- FS: field separator
  -- NF: number of fields (on a given line)
  -- NR: number of row; current row being processed
